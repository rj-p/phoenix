This document outlines how to write your own extensions and themes for Phoenix Code.

# Quick Start
Click on one of the below links and follow the instructions there to start:
* [Create a theme](https://github.com/phcode-dev/theme-template)
* [Create an extension](https://github.com/phcode-dev/extension-template)
* [Create a node.js extension](https://github.com/phcode-dev/extension-node-template)

# API docs
This is an evolving document, please refer the below links for extension API docs and how to's.
* Phoenix APIs - https://github.com/phcode-dev/phoenix/wiki#phoenix-api-docs
  * This is a work in progress. As we improve our documentation for phcode.dev, please check out the Brackets API docs too. 
* Brackets APIs are also supported- https://brackets.io/docs/current/
* Common How-Tos: https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/How-to-Write-Extensions#common-how-tos
* Take a look at our default extensions for code reference: https://github.com/phcode-dev/phoenix/tree/main/src/extensions/default

# Running and Debugging your extension
Follow the below step to run and debug your Extension/Theme:
* Clone your extension Repository into a folder. See [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to lean how to clone a repository from GitHub.
* Go to https://create.phcode.dev .This is a special development centric website of phcode.dev which shows non minified js/css files in the browser developer tools.
* Open the cloned folder and select `Debug > Load Project As Extension`

* The Theme/Extension will be loaded in Phoenix Editor now.
* You can now make code changes to your theme and live preview theme changes as you edit your theme css.

* You can also select `Debug> Reload With Extensions` to test the new code changes.
* When you are done developing the extension/theme, select `Debug> Unload Project As Extension` to unload the extension.
